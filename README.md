# XRInteractionToolkitTemplate

### Project description: 
This project serves as sample project for spatial audio. 
Explore sound in its basics in virtual reality (VR).

BASIC IDEA:
Escape room at the beginning there is a small sign with "Welcome to our Escape room". The environment of the Escape room consists of trees and stones covered with snow. In order to leave the maze again, 3 tasks have to be completed. We are guided through the maze acoustically, but also stylistically (by light and colour mood). The maze is basically designed with cold colours (blue, white,...). At the tasks, however, there are lanterns with warm light (orange, yellow,...) to guide us through the maze. Teleportation is used to move around.


### Development platform: 
OS: Windows 10, Game Engine: Unity 2020.3.18f1, Visual Studio 2019, XR Interaction Toolkit
